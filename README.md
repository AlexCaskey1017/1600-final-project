#### like with most career paths there are more than way to start. I would consider the IT field to be broken up into __three categories__ 
1. University degree programs
2. certifications/Technical training
3. coroperate ladder strategy 
___
### University degree programs
#### This path I am experienced in because it is what I am currently undertaking. I would say from school to school the programs emphasis and paths can vary a lot. There are some colleges doing a lot with coding, others heavily in the networking side, some are more into the graphic design style, and others focus on data or cyber security. This is why I love the [University of Missouri](https://online.missouri.edu/degreeprograms/engineering/information-technology/bachelors/?mzon_source=adwords&mzon_medium=expanded+text&mzon_campaign=information+technology+bs&mzon_term=info+tech+bs&mzon_content=broad&mzon_campaign=general&mzon_source=adwords&mzon_medium=dynamic+search&gclid=CjwKCAjwkPX0BRBKEiwA7THxiOCLa-snnA1Km-V3Nzyw7Oh6JMb0V12-O4CrFjGOIrgrqm93gYG8TRoCyKgQAvD_BwE) so much, because they are so broad and want to teach you about everything IT, you cn truly find your passion. Some of the pros of going to a university would be: team/group working readiness, lots of experience with different programs, and usually a very liveable starting pay. The cons being: its expensive, time consumming and difficult.
___
### [Certifications](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/certifications-in-the-tech-industry-2071456)/Technical training
#### This is something I dont have a lot of first hand experience on but I know is a very popular strategy to this growing field. Before Universities started offering IT programs this was the only way to acredit your self in the IT world besides work experience. A couple things I like about certifications is that they are cheaper than a university and quicker. The down side of them being they expire and and are very specific.
___
### [Coroperate Ladder](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-ladder.asp)
#### This is the strategy for someone who is patient. An example of this would be you start out at help desk/customer service and eventually over time get promotions and incharge of more things. Ive seen a lot of tenicians go this route. The internship I did last summer where I repaired computers for a near by school system was the perfect example of this. Younger people as field technicians and help desk employee, middle aged people as system analists and older people in the managepart part. With mostly all of them starting out as help desk. The pros of this is it take no money down to gain experience. The Cons being it could take a while.
___
### What to actually expect
#### from my understanding its really going to take a combination of a couple or all three categories. I found out vary recently that emplyers are looking for people that have done a little bit of everything. Take this summers internship for me for example. The require ments were that I am a sophomore or above, have had customer service positions in the past. and once I got the job my first task was to get a certification through them. After going through all that it really opened my eyes to what employers want.

### Why is it worth it?
#### if youre techinally oriented like myself there isnt even another option for a career path in this era. [There are so many jobs and so many different posistion](https://thebestschools.org/careers/best-information-technology-jobs/) to make sure you find your perfect niche. while we hope there is never another pandemic the amount of working from home options in the IT field is perfect for times like these.
